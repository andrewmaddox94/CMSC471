Project 3
Due: May 4th 
 
Your program should take a single argument, the filepath to a jpg.  It will then print out one of 
the following strings: 
 
Smile 
Hat 
Dollar 
Hash 
Heart 
 
You should include a readme explaining how to run and / or install your program. 
 
You should also include a report describing your approach, your accuracy, and anything else 
you think would be of interest.  This will likely be between two or three pages, and should be 
written in latex.
